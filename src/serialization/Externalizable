üîç Interview Questions
Question	Answer
Q1. What is Externalizable?	A Java interface allowing manual control over object serialization.
Q2. Is no-arg constructor required?	Yes, it's mandatory and gets called during deserialization.
Q3. When would you prefer Externalizable over Serializable?	When you want full control and better performance.
Q4. Does it skip transient/static fields like Serializable?	You can choose what to write/read, including/excluding anything manually.

üß† Difference: Serializable vs Externalizable
Feature	Serializable	Externalizable
Control	Default serialization	Manual control
Methods to override	None	writeExternal() & readExternal()
Performance	Slower	Faster (custom control)
Constructors	Not called	No-arg constructor must be present and is called


‚úÖ Day 71: Externalizable in Java (Advanced Serialization Control)
üîπ What is Externalizable?
Externalizable is an interface that gives you complete control over the serialization and deserialization process.

It extends Serializable, but requires you to manually override two methods:

java
Copy
Edit
public interface Externalizable extends Serializable {
    void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException;
    void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
}
