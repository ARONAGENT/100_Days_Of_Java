✅ What is Sign Bit? (in Hindi + English)
🧠 English:
In Java (and most languages), integers are stored in binary format using 2’s complement.
The leftmost bit (also called MSB – Most Significant Bit) is called the sign bit:

0 → Positive number
1 → Negative number

🧠 Hindi (Simple):
Java mein koi bhi number binary form mein store hota hai. Sabse aage ka bit (leftmost bit) hota hai sign bit.
Agar 0 hai, toh number positive hai.
Agar 1 hai, toh number negative hai.

🔁 Left Shift (<<) vs Right Shift (>>)

| Operator           | Use           | Sign Bit        | What it does                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `<<` (Left Shift)  | Multiply by 2 | ❌ Not preserved | Bits move left, fills 0 on right              |
| `>>` (Right Shift) | Divide by 2   | ✅ Preserved     | Bits move right, fills sign bit (0/1) on left |
