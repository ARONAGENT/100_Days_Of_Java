🧠 What is Left Shift?
The left shift operator (<<) shifts all bits in a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
Each shift to the left multiplies the number by 2.

🔍 How it Works (Binary Explanation)
Let’s take a = 5, which is:

Binary: 0000 0101
When you do a << 1:

Becomes: 0000 1010 → which is 10
So, 5 << 1 = 10

Similarly:

5 << 2 = 20 (5 × 2 × 2)
3 << 3 = 24 (3 × 8)


💡 When to Use Left Shift
For fast multiplication by powers of 2
In bitmasking or low-level optimizations
