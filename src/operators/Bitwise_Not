1️⃣ Theory
Type: Unary bitwise operator (works on a single operand)
Symbol: ~

Function: Flips each bit:
1 becomes 0
0 becomes 1

Important: In Java, integers are stored in two’s complement form
So ~x is mathematically equal to:

| Input bit | Output bit |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 0         | 1          |
| 1         | 0          |


6️⃣ Quick Facts
Works on byte, short, int, long
Always flips all bits, including the sign bit
Can be used for:
Inverting bitmasks
Simple data obfuscation
Logical toggling at bit level
