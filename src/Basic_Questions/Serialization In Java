💾 Java Concept: Serialization & transient keyword
📦 What is Serialization?
Serialization is the process of converting a Java object into a byte stream, so it can be:

Saved to a file

Transferred over a network

Stored in a database

✅ Use Case:
When saving object state (e.g., user session, game data)

In distributed systems (e.g., sending objects between microservices)

🔐 What is transient keyword?
Use transient to exclude a variable from being serialized.

🔍 Why use it?
Sensitive data (e.g., passwords)

Temporary or derived fields that don’t need saving

📌 Example:
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.*;

class User implements Serializable {
    String name;
    transient String password;  // Will not be serialized

    User(String name, String password) {
        this.name = name;
        this.password = password;
    }
}
After serialization, password will be null on deserialization.
