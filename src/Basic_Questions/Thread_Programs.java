/**
 * ‚úÖ What This Program Does:
 * You have a printTable(int n) method that prints the multiplication table for a given number with a 1-second delay between each line.
 * You create two Runnable tasks, one for printing the table of 2 and the other for 3.
 * Each Runnable is executed in its own thread using Thread.start().
 * Since both threads run concurrently, the tables print simultaneously (interleaved).

 * ‚ùó Important Notes:
 * This example demonstrates concurrency, but not synchronization.
 * If both threads were accessing shared resources, you‚Äôd need proper thread safety (synchronized, Locks, etc.).
 * Thread.sleep() is only used to simulate time delay and is not a synchronization tool.

//üí° Key Java Concepts Used:
//Concept	Description
//Runnable	A functional interface used to create a task that runs in a thread.
//Lambda	Used here to write Runnable implementations concisely.
//Thread.sleep(ms)	Pauses the current thread for the given time (in milliseconds).
//Thread class	Used to create and manage threads.
//Concurrency	Two tasks (print tables) are executed simultaneously.
