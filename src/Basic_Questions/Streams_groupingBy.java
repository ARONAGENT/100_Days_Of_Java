// how to group elements by using streams
/**
 * ðŸ’¡ Concept: groupingBy()
 * Collectors.groupingBy() is a collector that groups stream elements by a classifier function (e.g., group employees by department, college, age group, etc.).
 * It returns a Map<K, List<T>> where:
 * K is the key (e.g., college name)
 * List<T> is a list of items that belong to that grou
