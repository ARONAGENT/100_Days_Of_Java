Question	Answer
Q1. What is the role of Serializable interface?	It's a marker interface that enables serialization.
Q2. What happens if a class does not implement Serializable?	NotSerializableException is thrown.
Q3. What is the use of transient?	Prevents a variable from being serialized (e.g., passwords).
Q4. Can static variables be serialized?	No, because static variables belong to the class, not the object.
Q5. What is serialVersionUID?	It's a version ID used during deserialization to verify class compatibility.
Q6. What is Externalizable?	Interface that gives full control over serialization by overriding methods.
Q7. Can constructors run during deserialization?	No, constructors are not called during deserialization.




âœ… Day 70: Serialization in Java â€“ Interview-Style Notes
ðŸ”¸ What is Serialization in Java?
Serialization is the process of converting a Java object into a byte stream, so it can be:

Saved to a file

Sent over a network

Stored in memory (e.g., caching)

ðŸ”¹ Key Interface
java
Copy
Edit
public interface Serializable
Marker interface (no methods)

ðŸ”¹ Why use Serialization?
Save object state (persistence)

Send objects over socket/network (RMI, Web)

Store in cache or session (e.g., in Spring/Servlets)

ðŸ”¹ How to serialize a class?
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.*;

class Student implements Serializable {
    int id;
    String name;

    Student(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
}
Then write:

java
Copy
Edit
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("obj.ser"));
out.writeObject(new Student(1, "Rohan"));
ðŸ”¹ What is transient keyword?
If a variable is marked transient, it will not be saved during serialization.

java
Copy
Edit
transient String password; // will be skipped when serialized
