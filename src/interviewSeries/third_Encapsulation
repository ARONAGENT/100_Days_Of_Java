## âœ… **Day 77: Java Encapsulation â€“ Interview Questions**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Brief Concept Overview**

**Encapsulation** is the process of **wrapping data (variables) and code (methods)** together as a single unit (class) and **restricting direct access** to some of the objectâ€™s components â€” typically by making fields `private` and providing public `getters/setters`.

### ðŸ’¡ **Top Interview Questions on Encapsulation**

1. **What is encapsulation in Java?**
   â†’ It is binding the data and methods into a single unit and restricting access to it using access modifiers.

2. **Why is encapsulation important?**
   â†’ It provides data hiding, improves security, makes the code maintainable and flexible.

3. **How do you achieve encapsulation in Java?**
   â†’ By:

   * Declaring fields as `private`
   * Providing `public` getter and setter methods

4. **Can you give a real-life example of encapsulation?**
   â†’ A class representing a `BankAccount` that hides balance and allows access only via deposit/withdraw methods.

5. **What is the difference between encapsulation and abstraction?**

   * **Encapsulation**: Hides data (implementation details) via access modifiers.
   * **Abstraction**: Hides complexity by exposing only essential behavior via interfaces or abstract classes.

6. **Is it possible to achieve encapsulation without getters and setters?**
   â†’ Technically yes, using access control, but using getters/setters is the standard way.

7. **What happens if you make fields `public`?**
   â†’ You break encapsulation because data is exposed directly and cannot be controlled or validated.
