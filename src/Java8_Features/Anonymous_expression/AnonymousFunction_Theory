✅ What is an Anonymous Class in Java?
An anonymous class is a class without a name, used to create an instance of a class (or interface) on the fly,
 usually for short-term use — like overriding methods quickly without creating a separate .java file.

Useful when:
You need to override methods of an interface or abstract class.
You want to avoid boilerplate code.
