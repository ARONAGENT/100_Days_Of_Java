🔍 What is EnumMap?
EnumMap<K extends Enum<K>, V> is a Map implementation for enum keys.
It is faster and more efficient than HashMap when keys are enums.

✅ Why Use EnumMap?

| Feature                     | Benefit                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Only works with enum as key | Type-safe and predictable         |
| Internally uses an array    | Very **fast lookup & iteration**  |
| Maintains key order         | In the order enums are declared   |
| Compact & memory efficient  | Better than HashMap for enum keys |

✅ Common Methods
All standard Map methods like:
put()
get()
containsKey()
keySet()
entrySet()
